# Solr Deployment Notes

Apache Solr is the search index database used by the name examination system.

This documentation describes the process used when recreating the **solr** build and image in the
**servicebc-ne-tools** OpenShift project. Before creating these Solr artifacts, the **namex-solr-base** image must
exist in the OpenShift project **servicebc-ne-tools**. See the **bcgov/namex-solr** on GitHub for details if this image
does not exist.

This documentation assumes that **oc.exe** from OpenShift Origin Client Tools has been installed and that the user has
an account on the Pathfinder OpenShift cluster.

## Log in to OpenShift

Log into the [OpenShift Web Console](https://console.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca:8443/console). Click the drop-down for your
username in the upper-right corner, and select **Copy Login Command**. Paste the command into your shell:

```
C:\> oc login https://console.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca:8443 --token=<blahblahblah>
Logged into "https://console.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca:8443" as "<username>" using the token provided.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

    servicebc-ne-dev
    servicebc-ne-test
  * servicebc-ne-tools

Using project "servicebc-ne-tools".
```

(Note that you could also run **oc login** and enter the same credentials).

## Creating Solr

Creating Solr in a new environment is a fairly rare occurrence. It only needs to happen once, and subsequent changes
are picked up by *replacing*, below. As the creation process is nearly identical to the replacement process, just
follow the replacement instructions except using **create** rather than **replace** for the final **oc** call.

## Replacing Solr

*This step is used when the **solr** build already exists in the OpenShift project **servicebc-ne-tools**, but it needs
to be updated.*

### Replacing the Build

Ensure that your current project is **servicebc-ne-tools**:

```
C:\> oc project servicebc-ne-tools
```

Change directory to the OpenShift files for Solr in your local copy of the **bcgov/namex** repository:

```
C:\> cd \<path>\namex\solr\openshift
C:\<path>\namex\solr\openshift>
```

Generate the configuration file from the template and the parameters, and pipe the output back into **oc** to replace
the build:

```
C:\<path>\namex\solr\openshift> oc process -f templates\solr-build.json --param-file=solr-build.param | oc replace -f -
imagestream "solr" replaced
buildconfig "solr" replaced
```

In the OpenShift Web Console go to the **names examination (tools)** project, and then **Builds** > **Builds**. Wait
for the **solr** build to change Status to **Running** and then to **Complete**. You can also check the Created value
to ensure that it is recent. 

In the OpenShift Web Console go to the **names examination (tools)** project, and then **Builds** > **Images**. Click
the **solr** image and the tag **Latest** should now have been updated. The image needs to be pushed in order to get
it into a specific environment.

## Tagging an Image

A new Solr image must be tagged before it is deployed for a given *ENV* (**dev**, **test**, or **prod**):

```
C:\> oc tag servicebc-ne-tools/solr:latest servicebc-ne-tools/solr:ENV
Tag solr:ENV set to servicebc-ne-tools/solr@sha256:1d39a55e77076835a67e38ff01cc188cdc713839c96a19c4a14d92e124c269d2.
```

## Deploy

When deploying to *<ENV>* (dev / test / prod) ensure that your current project is **servicebc-ne-*<ENV>***. For
example, to deploy to dev:

```
C:\> oc project servicebc-ne-dev
```

Change directory to the OpenShift files for Solr in your local copy of the **bcgov/namex** repository:

```
C:\> cd \<path>\namex\solr\openshift
C:\<path>\namex\solr\openshift>
```

Generate the configuration file from the template and the parameters for your specific environment (dev / test / prod),
and pipe the output back into **oc** to replace the build. For example, to deploy to dev:

```
C:\<path>\namex\solr\openshift> oc process -f templates/solr-deploy.json --param-file=solr-deploy.dev.param | oc create -f -
service "solr" created
route "solr" created
persistentvolumeclaim "solr" created
deploymentconfig "solr" created
```

#### TODO: Clean up below and move to the above.
 

* Need  image.  See TheOrgBook/docker/manage for original "solr-base" build files.

created templates/solr-build.json

* BUILDNOTES for namex-solr
As per the project documentation but build will only work for local OpenShift

* Pipeline
* Adapted from https://github.com/BCDevOps/openshift-tools/blob/master/provisioning/pipeline/create-pipeline.sh
oc process -f solr-pipeline-build.json --param-file=solr-pipeline.param | oc create -f -

* Extracting a template from OpenShift
EXAMPLE: extracting a deployment config

oc export --as-template=solr-deploy dc solr-names -o json
--as-template=solr-deploy   is the name of the root object
dc                          is deployment config
solr-names                  is the name of the deployment config
-o json                     specifies json as the output format
